# API: Data Queries

The following subsections provide documentation for querying the Earth data that is stored in the LCMAP system.

LCMAP data are processed to a level that enables direct use in quantitative applications including:

* Exploratory data analysis
* Numerical modeling
* Geospatial, multispectral, and multi-temporal manipulation

These are made available for purposes of data reduction, analysis, and interpretation. Characteristics of these data include:

* Scaled or standardized physical units and data types
* Consistent spatial coverage and cartographic projection
* Common data formats and accompanying metadata of sufficient detail on data provenance, geographic extent, scaling coefficients, and processing history

These are provided in order to enable independent reconstruction of the dataset.
