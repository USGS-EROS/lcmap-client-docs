# API: Data Queries

The following subsections provide documentation for analysis-ready data (ARD).

ARD are processed to a level that enables direct use in quantitative applications including exploratory data analysis, numerical modeling, and geospatial, multispectral, and multi-temporal manipulation for purposes of data reduction, analysis, and interpretation. Characteristics of analysis-ready data include scaled or standardized physical units and data types, consistent spatial coverage and cartographic projection, common data format, and accompanying metadata of sufficient detail on data provenance, geographic extent, scaling coefficients, and processing history to enable independent reconstruction of the dataset.
