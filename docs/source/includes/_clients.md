# The Client Libraries

## Language Bindings & Status

> Development status of your client:

```shell
cURL Status: IN PROGRESS
```

```python
Python Status: INITIAL STAGES
```

```vb
Julia Status: NOT STARTED
```

```clojure
Clojure Status: IN PROGRESS
```

```ruby
Ruby Status: NOT STARTED
```

We plan to provide the following client libraries for LCMAP:

* Python <span class="status-initial-stages">[INITIAL STAGES]</span>
* Julia <span class="status-not-started">[NOT STARTED]</span>
* Clojure <span class="status-in-progress">[IN PROGRESS]</span>
* Ruby <span class="status-not-started">[NOT STARTED]</span>


## Viewing Per-language Examples

cURL and client access are demonstrated in the following document while using the same prose for describing the overall experience.

To view example code for any one of the language-specific libraries, be sure to select the appropriate tab in the upper-right of this docuemtnation site.


## Installation

> Install your client with the following:

```shell
# cURL installation is OS-dependent. For Ubuntu command-line:
sudo apt-get install curl
```

```python
# Until the LCMAP Python client library is released in PyPI, use git:
git clone git@github.com:USGS-EROS/lcmap-client-py.git
```

```vb
git clone git@github.com:USGS-EROS/lcmap-client-jl.git
```

```clojure
;; Until the LCMAP Clojure client library is released in Clojars, use git:
git clone git@github.com:USGS-EROS/lcmap-client-clj.git
```

```ruby
# There's not currently a Ruby client repo
```

Installation is dependent upon the client you want to use. How cURL gets installed is dependent upon your operating system , development platform, and/or package manater.

The client library installations each have their own method of installation. See the notes to the right for per-language details.
