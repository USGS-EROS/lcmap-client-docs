## WMTS

The Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) described in the [Open Geospatial Consortium](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts)'s [OpenGIS Web Map Tile Service Implementation Standard](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts) builds on earlier efforts to develop scalable, high performance services for web based distribution of cartographic maps. WMTS is inspired by the [OSGeo Tile Map Service Specification](http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/Tile_Map_Service_Specification). The team that worked on this standard also considered similar initiatives, such as Google maps and NASA OnEarth.

WMTS is the means by which LCMAP offers [QGIS](http://qgis.org/en/site/) integration.
