# Installation


```shell
# cURL installation is OS-dependent. For Ubuntu command-line:
sudo apt-get install curl
```

```python
# Until the LCMAP Python client library is released in PyPI, use git:
git clone git@github.com:USGS-EROS/lcmap-client-py.git
```

```vb
git clone git@github.com:USGS-EROS/lcmap-client-jl.git
```

```clojure
;; Until the LCMAP Clojure client library is released in Clojars, use git:
git clone git@github.com:USGS-EROS/lcmap-client-clj.git
```

Installation is dependent upon the client you want to use. How cURL gets installed is dependent upon your operating system , development platform, and/or package manater.

The client library installations each have their own method of installation. See the notes to the right for per-language details.
