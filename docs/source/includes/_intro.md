## About LCMAP

The intent of the Land Change Monitoring Assessment and Projection (LCMAP) initiative is to enable analysis of a very large amount of continuously acquired data to understand historical trends, assess current states, and project future states at regular intervals.

The system capacity and functionality needed to support the magnitude of long-term time series analysis is expected to employ Earth data science, demanding highly specialized computing environments to execute large scale analysis.


### Land Change

Land-change science is about understanding changes in the type, intensity, condition, and location of land use and cover as indications of possible impacts to and from the interactions between people and nature.

Toward this aim, the LCMAP system's goals are to:

1. Provide users and science models with direct access to a vast amount of Analysis Ready Data.

1. Assess and project changes to land cover, use, and condition.

1. Provide science users the means to continuously monitor and classify changes.

1. Support decision making relevant to environmental management and policy.

1. Enable discovery and distribution of information derived by science models through many channels, to many user communities.


### System Architecture

The system architecture and the components of which it is comprised has been designed to fulfill the LCMAP science user experience:

1. Access and Exploration - enables discovery, visualization, reporting, notification, and other access methods via REST resources and GIS standards for services and file formats.

1. Subscription and notification services - allows science users to continuously monitor land change data for events of particular interest.

1. Science Execution Environment (SEE) - enables rapid development, production, validation and deployment of science models.

1. Information Warehouse and Data Store - contains decades of Analysis Ready Data as well as new data as it is obtained from satellites and science model outputs.

1. Client Libraries, Documentation, and Tutorials - enable science users to automate the collection and processing of land change data and develop new science models.


## The REST Service

Since the LCMAP system service provides REST resource over HTTP, all of the client libraries are essentially wrappers around HTTP client libraries. To provide the best possible developer experience, these libraries strive to handle configuration, cumbersom tasks, or multiple calls as cleanly as possible with as little direct intervention on the part of the user as makes good, clean sense.


## Users and Roles

In order to use the LCMAP service, you need to be authenticated as a value user. To do this, you will need to register an account with the [USGS ERS](https://ers.cr.usgs.gov/login/) service (or use an existing one). Registration is simple and only takes a few seconds. After submitting your registration and verifying your email address, you will be ready to use the LCMAP REST service.


## Important Developer Notes

That being said, there are key things every developer should keep in mind, in order to better understand how the LCMAP service and its associated libraries work. This will aide in better code and provide the proper background in the event that debugging becomes necessary in your project.

Important things to note and remember:

* There is no version number in the URL; the version is passed in an ``Accept``
  header.
* File extensions in a query string (e.g., ``/some-resource?xml``) are not
  used to determine the content type; this is done using headers (``Accept``
  and ``Content-Type``).
* An authentication token is used in place of an API key; this is handled for
  you automatically as soon as you have logged in to the USGS authentication
  service.


## Conventions

We use styled call-outs to provide immediate visual cues about the nature of
the information being shared.

These are as follows:

<aside class="info">
This style indicates useful information, background, or other insights.
</aside>

<aside class="success">
This style indicates a best practice, good usage, and other tips for success.
</aside>

<aside class="caution">
This style indicates one should use caution or that behaviour may not be as
expected
</aside>

<aside class="danger">
This style indicates information that could cause errors if ignored.
</aside>

## HTTP Clients

Due to the nature of the LCMAP initiative, the supporting infrastrucuture is diverse and multi-faceted. Development on the system is on-going and subject to a great deal of change -- as such, there may be a lag between what exists in the code and what has been documented on this site.

Even while the greater LCMAP systm is under development, we are creating client libraries. We decided to to this early in the process, with the understanding that the overhead of maintaining a moving target is far out-weighed by the benefits of engaging with the science and development communities from the very beginning.


## Using cURL

> All cURL requests need to provide the version of the API you with to access in the ``Accept`` header:


```shell
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.usgs.lcmap.v0.5+json" \
  -d "username=`cat ~/.usgs/username`" \
  -d "password=`cat ~/.usgs/password`" \
  http://localhost:1077/api/auth/login | \
  jq -r '.token'
```
```shell
3efc6475b5034309af00549a77b7a6e3
```

> After authenticating, all cURL requests need to provide your access key via the ``X-AuthToken`` header:

```shell
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.usgs.lcmap.v0.5+json" \
  -H "X-AuthToken: 3efc6475b5034309af00549a77b7a6e3" \
  'http://localhost:1077/api/L3/sample/model?seconds=15&year=2016'
```
```shell
{"result":{"link":"/api/L3/sample/model/a4881a10c0026ee8bb4a50556bd665bc"}}
```

There are two ways in which one may interact with the LCMAP system as a
client:

* Directly, accessing the REST resources with ``cURL``
* Client libraries

The client libraries will be discussed in the next section; right now, we will provide an overview of things to keep in mind when using cURL:

* Since muliple versions of the API are supported and we do not support versions in the URL, every request must include the version in an ``Accept`` header.

See the notes to the right for details.

Note that one cURL example assumes that you have created the directory ``~/.usgs`` and have saved your [USGS ERS](https://ers.cr.usgs.gov/login/) username in ``~/.usgs/username`` your password in ``~/.usgs/password``.

<aside class="info">
To parse the JSON results in cURL, the <code>jq</code> command line utility is being used. See the <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq site</a> for more details.
</aside>

* The API token needs to be passed with every request as an ``X-AuthToken`` header.

<aside class="caution">
ERS tokens (what LCMAP uses behind the scenes) expire every two hours. When you get an HTTP 403 response, you will need to obtain a new token by authenticating against LCMAP again.
</aside>


## API Organization

The LCMAP REST service and client APIs have been organized into several key areas:

* **General** calls such as client initialization and user authentication
* **Querying** calls such as for Analysis Ready Data (ARD) or previous results from executing supported science models
* **Subscription** calls related to services for notifying users of subscribed land-change events
* **Model Execution** calls such as performing runs to build model data based on previous stored data or making predictions based on previous model runs
* **Management** calls such as system status, maintaining users, and modifying roles

Each of these is discussed in more detail below.
